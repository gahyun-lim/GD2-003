             Chapter 2:
            </a>
        </h1>

        <p>
            About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of
            a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes
            grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising
            smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
            Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately
            the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your
            sight.
            <br> But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,
            the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
            high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.
            Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down
            himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under
            sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
            <br> The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through,
            the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of
            at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.
            <br> The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up
            in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was
            curious to see her I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when
            we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car.
            <br> 'We’re getting off!’ he insisted. ‘I want you to meet my girl.’
            <br> I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious
            assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.
            <br> I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor
            Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land,
            a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for
            rent and another was an all-night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars
            Bought and Sold—and I followed Tom inside. [...]
