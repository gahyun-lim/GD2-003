             Chapter 3:
            </a>
        </h1>

        <p>
            There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went
            like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving
            from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the
            Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from
            the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to
            meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and
            hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.
            
            <br> Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and
            lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice
            of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb.
            <br> At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights
            to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked
            hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a
            bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his
            female guests were too young to know one from another.
            <br> By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and
            saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and
            are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and
            verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The
            bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter
            and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never
            knew each other’s names.
            <br> The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music
            and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at
            a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath—already
            there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
            joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and
            color under the constantly changing light. [...]
